description: Jordi is an FNR Pearl Chair and head of the Software Engineering RDI Unit at the ITIS department of the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST). Jordi is also an Affiliate Professor in CS at the University of Luxembourg. Previously, Jordi had been an ICREA Research Professor at Internet Interdisciplinary Institute, the Research center of the Open University of Catalonia (UOC) where Jordi led the SOM Research Lab. <br> Jordi's research falls into the broad area of systems and software engineering, especially promoting the rigorous use of software models in all software tasks while keeping an eye on the most unpredictable element in any project, the people involved in it. Current research topics include pragmatic formal verification techniques, analysis of open source communities, open data exploitation and the role AI can play in software development (and vice versa). Letâ€™s use all the tools at our disposal to build Better Software Faster.
