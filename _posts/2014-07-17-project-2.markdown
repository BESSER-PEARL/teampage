description: Jean-Sébastien is studying how model-driven approaches can be applied to no-code data-centric applications. BESSER models could be the entry point to design data model used in those applications. Indeed, the current existing no-code approaches (a preliminary study can be found at https://doi.org/10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00138) are actually not offering all the modelling features that BESSER, through BUML, is able to provide (e.g., those tools lack of clear and simple implementation of bidirectional relations).<br><br>Jean-Sébastien also focuses on modelling framework flexibility, notably relaxing the conformance relation between metamodel and model. Such flexibility, allows expressing a form of uncertainty, the trade-off made when linking to other models or discovering data structures. This should be associated with mechanisms to relax and enforce conformance according to the situation, ultimately allowing for creating a metamodel element from a given (prototypical) model instance.
